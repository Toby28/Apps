We\\nopenly release the collected data, data cura-\\ntion procedure, training code, and final model\\nweights to promote open research and repro-\\nducibility. Additionally, we release quantized\\n4-bit versions of the model allowing virtually\\nanyone to run the model on CPU.\\n1 Data Collection and Curation\\nWe collected roughly one million prompt-\\nresponse pairs using the GPT-3.5-Turbo OpenAI\\nAPI between March 20, 2023 and March 26th,\\n2023. To do this, we first gathered a diverse sam-\\nple of questions/prompts by leveraging three pub-\\nlicly available datasets:\\n• The unified chip2 subset of LAION OIG.\\n• Coding questions with a random sub-sample\\nof Stackoverflow Questions\\n• Instruction-tuning with a sub-sample of Big-\\nscience/P3\\nWe chose to dedicate substantial attention to data\\npreparation and curation based on commentary in\\nthe Stanford Alpaca project (Taori et al., 2023).\\nUpon collection of the initial dataset of prompt-\\ngeneration pairs, we loaded data into Atlas for data\\ncuration and cleaning. With Atlas, we removed all\\nexamples where GPT-3.5-Turbo failed to respond\\nto prompts and produced malformed output. This\\nreduced our total number of examples to 806,199\\nhigh-quality prompt-generation pairs. Next, we\\ndecided to remove the entire Bigscience/P3 sub-\\nset from the final training dataset due to its very\\nFigure 1: TSNE visualization of the candidate training\\ndata (Red: Stackoverflow, Orange: chip2, Blue: P3).\\nThe large blue balls (e.g. indicated by the red arrow)\\nare highly homogeneous prompt-response pairs.\\nlow output diversity; P3 contains many homoge-\\nneous prompts which produce short and homoge-\\nneous responses from GPT-3.5-Turbo. This exclu-\\nsion produces a final subset containing 437,605\\nprompt-generation pairs, which is visualized in\\nFigure 2. You can interactively explore the dataset\\nat each stage of cleaning at the following links:\\n• Cleaned with P3\\n• Cleaned without P3 (Final Training Dataset)\\n2 Model Training\\nWe train several models finetuned from an in-\\nstance of LLaMA 7B (Touvron et al., 2023).\\nThe model associated with our initial public re-\\nlease is trained with LoRA (Hu et al., 2021)\\non the 437,605 post-processed examples for four\\nepochs.
