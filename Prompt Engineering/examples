Prompt Engineering Framework:

The setup -> system message(Custom Instructions) -> Persona -> Context -> The instruction
The instruction -> delimeters -> instructions(clear & specific X-Y problems) -> examplars(zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot) -> Chain-of-Thought Prompt(Zero-shot COT "Let's think step by step) -> token management 
-> hyperparameters (temperature, Top-p)-> consider additional Techniques
